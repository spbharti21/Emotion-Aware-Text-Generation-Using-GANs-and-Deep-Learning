# Emotion-Aware Text Generation using GANs and Deep Learning

This project explores generating emotionally-aware text using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) combined with deep learning models.

## 🚀 Features
- Emotion-conditioned text generation
- GAN architecture tailored for sequence data
- Emotion classification for training supervision
- Custom preprocessing pipeline for text and emotion labels
